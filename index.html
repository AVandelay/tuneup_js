  <h1>Overview</h1>

  <p>
    Tune-up is a collection of JavaScript utilities that builds upon and improves
    the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/InstrumentsUserGuide/UsingtheAutomationInstrument/UsingtheAutomationInstrument.html">UIAutomation</a> library provided by Apple for testing iOS applications via
    Instruments (get it? "tune-up"? Instruments? get it?).
  </p>

  <p>
    While the JavaScript library provided by Apple is fairly complete and robust,
    it is a bit wordy and repetitive at times. This project aims to reduce as much
    pain as possible when writing UI tests by enhancing the existing API. It also
    provides some basic structure for your tests in a manner familiar to most
    testers.
  </p>

  <p>
    For an example of how you can use tuneup, please take a look at the
    <a href="https://github.com/alexvollmer/UICatalog-Tests">UICatalog-Tests</a>
    sample project.
